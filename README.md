# Character / Game Music layout for Tournament Stream Helper

These layouts allow you to play specific music tracks in OBS based on the currently set game in Tournament Stream Helper, or the characters set for each player in scoreboard #1. The MP3 file corresponding to the current situation will start playing upon loading the layout, as well as when switching character/game.

This is what is used notably in WolfTV stream to play the Street Fighter 6 character themes during Wolf Warrior and From Pack to Pack events (Example of the layout in action: https://www.youtube.com/live/U3NhSe40kCc?t=1333)

## Pre-requisites

- A functional install of [Tournament Stream Helper v5.751](https://github.com/joaorb64/TournamentStreamHelper/releases) or higher, with `base_files` asset packs installed for any game you want to use this with
- A functional install of a stream software which can load and display webpages, such as [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)
